# Dangerous_R_Cookbook
Just enough R to be dangerous!

Dangerous R Cookbook is a set of tutorials for various R packages. 
They are designed to take an intermediate R user from zero to proficient as quickly as possible.

**Current Topics**

* ggplot2  


By design, each tutorial teaches exactly one approach that can be used (hopefully) 
for 90% of practical R programming tasks. For example, the ggplot2 Cookbook completely omits the `qplot()`
function because it replicates functionality of the more powerful `ggplot() + ...` functions.

All cookbook code works as written. When in doubt:

1. Copy
2. Paste
3. Play

Each cookbook directory is created with the 
[R Project Template]("http://projecttemplate.net/getting_started.html") package.
Rmd source and html/pdf/LaTeX output files are in **r_package_name/docs**
